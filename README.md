# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020

During this course you will learn how to build a **meaningful** real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

## Goals
- _Deal with real-time complexity_
- _Handle real-time client-server interaction_
- _Handle real-time data management_
- _Handle multi-user support_
